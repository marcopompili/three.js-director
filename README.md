Camera Director for Three.js

Director tries to bring the cinema techniques into Three.js, it is inspired by
the [Director class from zz85](https://github.com/zz85/ThreeLabs/blob/master/Director.js)
and extends the idea introducing cinema concepts into Three.js.

## Director class

TODO: add description of the main class

## Shots

A list of cinematic shots supported by Director at the moment.

*   Aerial shot: A shot taken from a hat, helicopter or a person on top of a
building. Not necessarily a moving shot. The main source of light is behind the
subject, silhouetting it, and directed toward the camera.

*   Dolly shot: A set of wheels and a platform upon which the camera can be
mounted to give it mobility. Dolly shot is a shot taken from a moving dolly.
Almost synonymous in general usage with tracking shot or follow shot.

*   (Pan) Panoramic shot: Movement of the camera from left to right or right
to left around the imaginary vertical axis that runs through the camera.
A panning shot is sometimes confused with a tracking shot.
