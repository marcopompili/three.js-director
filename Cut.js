/*
 * Base class for a Cut
 *
 * The splicing of two shots together. This cut is made by the film editor at
 * the editing stage of a film. Between sequences the cut marks a rapid
 * transition between one time and space and another, but depending on the
 * nature of the cut it will have different meanings.
